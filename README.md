## Installation

current version: *coming soon*

#### 🐘 Gradle

```kotlin
repositories {
    maven("https://maven.dimensional.fun/releases")
}

dependencies {
    // common:
    implementation("dimensional.usagi:usagi:{VERSION}")
}
```

## Usage

> **Note**  
> This API is not final, it may change in the future.

**Create a Channel:**

```kotlin
val connection = Usagi.connect("amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672")
val channel = connection.channels.create() ?: error("Unable to create channel")
```

**Using Exchanges & Queues**
```kotlin
channel.exchange.declare { 
    exchange = "my-exchange" 
}

val queueName = channel.queue.declare().queue
channel.queue.bind {
    exchange = "my-exchange"
    queue = queueName
    routingKey = "my-routing-key"
}
```

**Publishing Messages:**
```kotlin
channel.basic.publish {
    data = "Hello, World!".decodeToString()
    
    properties {
        contentType = "text/plain"
    }
    
    options {
        exchangeName = "my-exchange"
        routingKey = "my-routing-key"
    }
}
```

**Consuming Messages:**
```kotlin
val consumer = channel.basic.consume {
    exchangeName = "my-exchange"
    routingKey = "my-routingKey"
}

consumer.on<MessagePublishedEvent> {
    println(delivery.data.encodeToString()) // >> 'Hello, World'
    delivery.ack(multiple = false)
}
```
